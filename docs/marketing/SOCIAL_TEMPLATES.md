### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
🧵 I built an open-source "digital twin" that learns to think like you.

Unlike screen recorders that capture pixels, this AI asks "Why did you do that?" after EVERY action.

Here's how Mnemosyne works:
```

### Tweet 2
```
1/ Most screen recorders capture PIXELS.
Mnemosyne captures INTENT.

After every click, keystroke, or app switch, the AI asks: "Why?"

Over time, it builds a model of YOUR thought patterns.
```

```
2/ It records EVERYTHING at microsecond precision:
• Mouse clicks & trajectories
• Keyboard inputs & hotkeys
• App switches & window focus
• Screenshots at key moments

All stored LOCALLY. Privacy-first. 🔒
```

### Tweet 4
```
3/ The "Curious LLM" finds patterns YOU didn't notice:

"You typed 'git status' 47 times but only committed 5x.
That's a 9:1 check-to-commit ratio.
Anxiety or process?"

🤯 AI-powered self-reflection
```

### Tweet 5
```
4/ OCR Search: Find ANYTHING you've ever seen on screen

"That API key from last week's Slack message"
→ Instantly searchable

Never lose track of what you saw again.
```

### Tweet 6
```
5/ Action Replay: Time-travel through your sessions

See what you did, when, and WHY (AI-inferred intent)

Perfect for:
• Debugging your workflow
• Finding lost information
• Understanding your habits
```

### Tweet 7
```
6/ Multi-LLM support:
• OpenAI GPT-4
• Anthropic Claude 3
• Google Gemini
• Local Ollama models

Use the AI you trust. Run completely offline if you want.
```

### Tweet 8
```
7/ Coming soon:
🎯 Goal execution (your digital twin acts for you)
📊 Habit tracking with AI insights
🔄 Cross-device sync

The future: A digital clone that truly thinks like you.

## LinkedIn Post

```markdown
🧠 Excited to share Mnemosyne - an open-source AI that creates a digital clone by learning how you think.

**The Problem:**
Traditional automation records WHAT you do, but not WHY. Scripts break in new situations because they don't understand intent.

**The Solution:**
Mnemosyne records every micro-action (clicks, keystrokes, app switches) and has a "Curious AI" that continuously asks "Why did you do this?" to understand your thought patterns.

**Key Features:**
📹 Micro-action recording with millisecond precision
🤔 AI that asks questions to understand your intent
📊 Daily summaries: "You typed 'git status' 47 times but committed 5x"
🔍 OCR search: Find text from any screenshot
⏪ Action replay: See what, when, and WHY you did it
🔒 Privacy-first: All data stored locally

**Tech Stack:**
• Python 3.11+ with async-first architecture
• Multi-LLM: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama
• ChromaDB for semantic memory
• FastAPI web interface

**I'm looking for:**
• Early adopters to provide feedback
• Contributors (Python, ML, React)
• Ideas for new use cases

GitHub: https://github.com/Min-Jihong/mnemosyne

If you've ever wished you had a digital version of yourself, check it out!

## Reddit Post (r/Python, r/MachineLearning)

### Title
```
[P] Mnemosyne: Open-source digital twin that learns your thought patterns from computer behavior
```

### Body
```markdown
Hey everyone! I've been working on Mnemosyne, an open-source project that creates a digital clone by learning from your computer behavior.

**The Problem:**
Traditional automation tools record *what* you do, but not *why*. They replay fixed scripts that break in new situations.

**The Solution:**
Mnemosyne records every micro-action (clicks, keystrokes, app switches) and has a "Curious AI" that asks "Why did you do this?" to understand your intent.

**What makes it different:**
- 🤔 **Intent inference**: AI asks "Why?" after every action
- 📊 **Daily AI summaries**: "You typed 'git status' 47 times but only committed 5x"
- 🔍 **OCR search**: Find text from any screenshot you've taken
- ⏪ **Action replay**: See what you did, when, and *why*
- 🔒 **Privacy-first**: Local storage, PII scrubbing, your choice of LLM
- 🔌 **Multi-LLM**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local Ollama

**Tech stack:**
- Python 3.11+, async-first architecture
- FastAPI web interface
- ChromaDB for semantic memory
- pyobjc for macOS native capture

**GitHub**: https://github.com/Min-Jihong/mnemosyne

Looking for:
- Feedback from early adopters
- Contributors (especially for Windows/Linux support)
- Ideas for new features

Any questions or suggestions welcome!

```
Show HN: Mnemosyne – Open-source digital twin that learns how you think
```

### Text
```
Hi HN! I built Mnemosyne, an open-source tool that creates a digital clone of yourself by learning from your computer behavior.

Unlike screen recorders that capture pixels, Mnemosyne's AI asks "Why did you do that?" after every action and builds a model of your thought patterns.

**Key features:**
• Micro-action recording (mouse clicks, keystrokes, app switches)
• Curious AI that infers intent ("Why did you switch apps 47 times?")
• OCR search: Find anything you've seen on screen
• Action replay: Time-travel through sessions with AI-inferred intent
• Privacy-first: PII scrubbing, local storage
• Multi-LLM: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local Ollama

**Use cases:**
- Understand your productivity patterns
- Search for "that thing I saw last week"
- Build a digital twin that can act on your behalf

**Tech:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, ChromaDB, multi-provider LLM abstraction

GitHub: https://github.com/Min-Jihong/mnemosyne

Would love feedback and contributions! Especially interested in:
- Windows/Linux capture support
- Additional LLM integrations
- ML training pipeline improvements
